#### Create your article file
* **Only one person in your group will create the file!**
* In your GitHub `lyricalmap` repository `[githubusername] / lyricalmap`, navigate to the `_posts` directory.
* You are going to create a new file here by clicking the "Create New File" button [](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/create_new_file.png)
* The first think we want to do is name our file - **The filename is important!**
    * Start the file name with today's date in this format: `YYYY-MM-DD`, for example `2018-02-12`
    * Next in the filename will be and underscore `_` followed by the quarter, for example `w18` for Winter 2018
    * Next will be another underscore, followed by your group number, for example `_01` for group 1
    * Finally, add the Markdown file extension `.md` -- you'll end up with something like: `2018-02-12_w18_01.md`
* Now that we've given our file a name, let's add some of the "Frontmatter", or the article's metadata. Copy and paste the following into the text area of your file - make sure you get all the lines, including the three dashes on the first and last lines!:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kirschbombe/a806fe27ca6c9edb46c06c209b79d1f1.js"></script>

* While we're here, let's give the article a proper title. See where is says "enter your title here" next to the `title:` field? Let's replace this text (but leave the quotes) with the title of your article. You can always change this later if you decide, so don't worry if it's not perfect.
* Now that you've added your frontmatter and given your article a title, scroll down to bottom of the page, make sure "**Commit directly to the `master` branch**" option is selected, then click on the "**Commit changes**" button.

#### Previewing your article stub
* To view your article stub, visit the live project site for your repository.
* Once there, click on the "hamburger" menu to expand and select "Article Index". Look for your article title in the list and click on it.
* There's not much there now, but you'll soon fill it in :)
