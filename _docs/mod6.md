#### Create your article file
* **Only one person in your group will create the file!**
* In your GitHub `lyricalmap` repository `[githubusername] / lyricalmap`, navigate to the `_posts` directory.
* You are going to create a new file here by clicking the "Create New File" button [](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/create_new_file.png)
* The first think we want to do is name our file - **The filename is important!**
    * Start the file name with today's date in this format: `YYYY-MM-DD`, for example `2018-02-12`
    * Next in the filename will be and underscore `_` followed by the quarter, for example `w18` for Winter 2018
    * Next will be another underscore, followed by your group number, for example `_01` for group 1
    * Finally, add the Markdown file extension `.md` -- you'll end up with something like: `2018-02-12_w18_01.md`
* Now that we've given our file a name, let's add some of the "Frontmatter", or the article's metadata. Copy and paste the following into the text area of your file:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kirschbombe/a806fe27ca6c9edb46c06c209b79d1f1.js"></script>
* While we're here, let's give the article a proper title. See where is says "enter your title here" next to the `title:` field? Let's replace this text (but leave the quotes) with the title of your article. You can always change this later if you decide, so don't worry if it's not perfect.
* Now that you've added your frontmatter and given your article a title, scroll down to bottom of the page, make sure "**Commit directly to the `gh-pages` branch**" option is selected, then click on the "**Commit changes**" button.

#### Previewing your article stub
* To view your article stub, visit the live project site for your repository.
* Once there, click on the "hamburger" menu to expand and hover over "Articles". The first articles listed should have the name "[Article title]". You can click on any one of these to see how the template for your article looks.
* Take a look at the various sections and notice the placeholder text in `[ ]` -- these are text areas that you will complete as you work on your articles.

#### Locating your article stub `.md` file and making your first edits
* In the top right corner of the file, look for the pencil icon. Click this to edit the file. ![](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/edit-file-edit-button.png)

#### View your site with your new article title
* Return to the live project site again. Does your site load?
* Now click on the "hamburger" menu near the top of the page, hover over the "Articles" menu item, and make sure your article is listed there (it should now be the new article title that you entered into the `title:` field). Go ahead and click on it to make sure it displays. If you don't see the changes, you may need to [clear your browser's cache](../content/browser_cache.html) or open in a new browser.
