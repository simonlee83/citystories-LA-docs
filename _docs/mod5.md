#### Fork the lyrical map site
Now it's time to make your own copy of the repo/site (or "fork" it) so you can add your own content to the map!
* **Only one person in your group should fork the site**. The others will be added as collaborators and will be able to work directly on the site that way.
* While logged in to your GitHub account, visit the `lyricalmap` repository: `https://github.com/CityStoriesUCLA/lyricalmap`
* See in the top right corner where is has the "Fork" button? Click on it. ![](https://www.linode.com/docs/assets/github-fork.png)
* You'll see an animation letting you know that GitHub is copying the site over to your account.
* Once that's done, you should see the `lyricalmap` repository, with all the folders and files, in your own GitHub account. Check the top of the page and make sure it has `[youraccountname] / lyricalmap`.
* Do you see the `_posts` folder from the "[Prepare for Lab session 1](../mod4/)" assignment?

#### Visit your live page
_We want to make sure everything is working correctly, so let's visit your live project page. To do this:_
* Click on "Settings" in the right-hand column. (next to graphs)
![](settings screenshot.png)
* Scroll down to the box titled "GitHub Pages" and click on the link next to "Your site is published at".
* It should look something like `http://[githubusername].github.io/lyricalmap`
* You should see your version of _Los Angeles:The City and the Library_ project site. **If you see "Error 404 Site not found", don't panic!** Sometimes GitHub takes a while to build a new GitHub Pages site. We can check back later. If you have another issue, let us know!

#### Add your teammates as collaborators
Now let's add your teammates as collaborators to your forked site so they can contribute!
* **Only the one team member that forked the site needs to add collaborators.**
* Back in your GitHub repository (not the live project site), go to "Settings" again.
* In the left navigation, there is a menu item for "Collaborators" - click it. ![](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/repo-settings-collaborators.png)
* In the text box, enter the GitHub usernames of your teammates, one by one, clicking on the "Add collaborator" button after each one.
* Go ahead and add your instructors as collaborators (using their GitHub usernames). This will come in handy if your instructors need to help you troubleshoot down the road.
* You should now see each of your teammates listed here.
* Your collaborators will receive an email letting them know they can contribute to your new forked repository.
* Collaborators should log in to their GitHub accounts and see `lyricalmap` in their list of repositories once they have accepted the invite. Collaborators should get an email, but can also check their [Notifications](https://github.com/notifications) in GitHub.

#### Add your project site link to your GitHub repository
* For easier access, you can add the URL to your published site to the top of your repository page.
* Navigate to the main repository page -- just under the tabs you'll see "No description for website provided. - Edit". It might already have the URL to the main site here (`http://citystoriesucla.github.io/lyricalmap`). We want to replace it.
* Click on "Edit".
* Add the URL from "Settings : GitHub Pages" to the "Website" field. Click "Save".
* Now you can quickly visit your live page from your main repository page!

Once you've completed the steps above, your group should be all set to start your encoding project!
